# mkpass, the simple, handy password generator

The purpose of mkpass is to generate random strings suitable for passwords.

mkpass accepts the following options to allow the user to select which characters will be included in the random string.
    '-a' for letters (both upper and lower case)
    '-n' for numbers
    '-p' for punctuation
    '-e' for extended

mkpass also accepts the option '-l' to set a custom length.
    '-l 32'

By default, mkpass will generate a 16 character string pulling from all the character sets.
